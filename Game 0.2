How to run in VS Code:
Save the code as a Python file (e.g., game.py).
Open the file in VS Code.
Click the "Run" button in the top right corner (green triangle) or right-click in the editor and select "Run Python File in Terminal."
This code provides a fundamental framework. To make it more like Free Fire, you would need to add:
More complex graphics and assets: Sprites, backgrounds, etc.
Level design: Maps, obstacles.
Multiple enemy types and AI.
Health and scoring systems.
Weapon variety.
User interface elements.
Networking for multiplayer (significantly more complex).
